# Consul Envoy Compatibility

This folder runs compatibility tests with a simple L7 config against different combos of Consul and Envoy

## Requirements

* [Shipyard](https://shipyard.run/docs/install)
* Docker

## Running tests

To run the tests use the `test.sh` script inside this folder. The script will create a single node Consul
cluster with a 2 tier app and execute a simple test for L7 routing.

Every Consul / Envoy combination is run against a fresh cluster and application, each iteration takes approximately 30s to run.

```

To add more Consul / Envoy versions to the test matrix you can edit the following variables in the `test.sh` script.

```
consul_version=("1.8.0" "1.7.2")
envoy_version=("1.14.2" "1.13.2" "1.13.1" "1.12.4" "1.12.3" "1.11.2" "1.10.0")
```
